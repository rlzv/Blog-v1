# Blog-v1

This is a Blog web application that works as a journal. When you enter the app you have 4 clickable sections, home, about us, contact us and post. When you click on the post you can compose an article for yourself that get's displayed into the home page and after it's displayed,you can click on "Read More" to get redirected to a dynamically website created for the article.


This project uses EJS for templating, for creating dynamically pages, NodeJS and Express to make the app run server side. I used CSS and Bootstrap3.3.7(because I could find more informations about forms into the docs) for styling.
